#Things I need to do

####immediately
- nothing :) (for now)


####before too much has changed
- turn comments for functions into documentation blocks
- add wasm compatability and ci/cd
- make a website for wasm demo + downloads page


####some time in the future
- re-create ci/cd deployment for more platforms (maybe also upload to website or incorporate a ui for adding notes and ect?)
- add code for proper wasm support
- replace all the linear algebra from the rasterizer with a homemade library
- add support for loading .gltf files (better for web)
- replace cgmath with glam?
