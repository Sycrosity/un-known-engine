# unknown-engine-rs

a hopefully (or hopelessly, depending how you look at it) simple 3d rasterizing engine build in rust from scratch using wgpu (and its tutorial)

this project isn't designed to be used by anyone but me, for a future project i'm working on - it's most likely janky, finicky and really really stupid.
